# Lab 2
## Variant 1
- Find the root vertex of the graph (All other vertices in the graph can be reached from the root vertex)
- If graph chas multiple root vertices code should return any one vertex index
- If the graph has no root vertices, the code should return -1
- An adjacency list to represent the graph should be read from the input.txt file
- Result should be written to the output.txt file
